<p>I kicked this problem around in my head for a few days. The &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way to solve it was to use multivariable calculus&ndash;which I have not yet learned. Still, I felt like there was some way to understand this problem without calculus. I was focused mostly on the parts <em>not</em> present in &ldquo;Aria&rsquo;s Sphere.&rdquo; The four caps left over after cutting the square out are the complement of the surface area of the entire sphere, whose volume can be known by \( 4\pi r^2 \). I felt like there should be <em>some</em> easily calculable relationship between the radius of a cap (a portion of a sphere) and its surface area. Where \( r_{cap} = r_{sphere} \), the surface area is equal to \( 2\pi r^2 \), because at that point the cap is a hemisphere, so the surface area will be half that of a full sphere.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have time to work on this for a while, but a recent camping trip gave me some time to think. The rest of the group left to get more water and access flushable toilets, but I was ready to have some alone-time. My friend and I stayed behind and I was able to spend some distraction-free time with my notebook. I drew out a top view of the complement of the Aria-sphere (4 caps of equal size, arranged so that there is a square hole in the middle). There I drew a diagram, and began to think about the relationship between arc length and angle. Of course, angle is defined by the arc length divided by the radius, or \( \theta = \frac{AL}{r} \). Thus, \( {AL} = \theta{r} \). Thinking about this relationship made me think about how it could be generalized to a 3D circle (a sphere). Rather than trying to find the surface area of the caps based on their maximum radius, perhaps I could find the surface area based on the angle at which the plane cuts through the sphere. I drew a quick diagram of a top view of the sphere, and imagined the following animation:</p>

<p>I then began trying to find an equation for \( {SA} \) where:</p>
<p>when \(\theta = 0 | 2\pi \),  \( SA = 0 \);</p>
<p>when \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} | \frac{3\pi}{2} \), \( SA = 2\pi r^2 \);</p>
<p>and when \( \theta = \pi \),  \( SA = 4\pi r^2 \)</p>
<p>This is the point at which I began making some logical leaps, and doing some guessing and checking. Although guess n&rsquo; check is almost never the most efficient way to do math, I like allowing myself to &ldquo;play with&rdquo; the numbers. I feel like standard math education doesn&rsquo;t really encourage creative problem solving, and that has hindered my ability to see the beauty in math until recently. This isn&rsquo;t to say schools are bad at teaching math, I am able to learn math that took thousands of years of slow progress to discover in just a few months. Still, I take great joy in playing with the mathematical tools I&rsquo;ve been given, even if there is a more efficient way to solve the problem.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>After guessing and checking several equations for SA, I realized that the table of proportions above followed the equation \( \sin^2(\frac{\theta}{2}) \). So, for a unit sphere, the surface area of a segment would be given by $$ 4\pi \sin^2(\frac{\theta}{2}) $$; for a general sphere, $$ 4\pi (\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})r)^2 $$. Plugging in each of the values in the table, this seemed to be the correct equation for finding the surface area of a portion of a sphere.</p>
<p>So now, after all this time, I could finally calculate the surface area of the &ldquo;Aria Sphere&rdquo;:</p>
<p>$$ 4\pi 2^2 - 4(4\pi (\sin(\frac{\frac{\pi}{4}}{2})2)^2) $$</p>
<p>$$ = 16\pi - 4(4\pi \sin^2(\frac{\pi}{8})4) $$</p>
<p>$$ = 16\pi - 64\pi \sin^2(\frac{\pi}{8}) $$</p>
<p>$$ = 16\pi(1-4\sin^2(\frac{\pi}{8})) $$</p>
<p>This is where I left the problem on the camping trip. I didn&rsquo;t have access to the internet to check. Upon returning home, I discovered that my answer could be further simplified to</p>
<p>$$ 16\pi(\sqrt{2}-1) $$</p>
<h2 id="oh-wait-thats-just-a-steradian">Oh wait, that&rsquo;s just a steradian</h2>
<p>Before this, I had briefly encountered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steradian">steradians</a>, but the concept had not crossed my mind while trying to solve this problem. In summary, a steradian is the 3 dimensional analogy to a radian. While a radian is defined by the arc length divided by the radius, a steradian is defined by the equation $$ \Omega = (\frac{SA}{r})^2 $$. Finding the surface area of a portion of a sphere is just the same as finding the arc length of a portion of a circle. Scrolling to the bottom of the wikipedia article, the exact formula I found, $$ 4\pi (\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})r)^2 $$, was listed, along with a slightly more elegant equivalent: $$ 2\pi(1-\cos(\theta)) $$.</p>
<p>I note this because I think it&rsquo;s really fun to &ldquo;discover&rdquo; a mathematical concept without formally learning about it. Something about finding a property or equation, only to discover that it is a well known concept with a name and notation is really fun to me. Playing with numbers, recognizing patterns, and discovering properties helps me appreciate the beauty of math in a way that&rsquo;s hard to explain. Geometric problems like this in particular are interesting. The concepts of sine waves, radians, steradians, and polar coordinates feel a little abstract when you first learn them. It isn&rsquo;t immediately clear how they&rsquo;re all connected. Unpacking problems like these, though, have helped me develop mathematical intuition and appreciate the connectedness of it all.</p>
