My name is Kyle Hollars, I am a graduate from Watauga High School and a student at NC State University. I plan on majoring in engineering--so far the plan is computer science but that is subject to change. This website is just a place to hold and organize some of my online projects, including Book N, a blog where I explore math and other subjects. I'll probably also include some other non-math programming projects here. 



Mostly, this website is an exercise in teaching myself web design skills. I have programmed with Java a lot for FTC Robotics, and have played with a few other languages, but I haven't done very much web design. I am using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) engine to create this site, but I have written everything on this site from scratch. I did draw some inspiration from the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme by Radek Kozie≈Ç, though. I would like to share this theme publicly some day, but for now it is very much in-development.
